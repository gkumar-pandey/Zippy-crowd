                        paying clients, you&apos;re going to need a way to get
                        people in your community to talk about you, endorse your

                        Word of mouth is arguably the most important marketing
                        tactic of any business. 92% of people trust
                        recommendations from friends and family over any other
                        type of advertising. In today’s hyper-connected world, a
                        single recommendation from someone you trust will have
                        far greater impact. At ZippyCrowd each recommendation
                        comes from people you know, cutting through the noise,
                        saving time, energy and money, and
